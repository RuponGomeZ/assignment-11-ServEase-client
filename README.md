## 🛡️ Protected Routes

The following routes require a valid JWT token:

- `GET /bookService/:email`
- `GET /servicesToDo/:email`
- `PATCH /serviceToDo/changeStatus/:id`
- `GET /manageService/:email`
- `DELETE /manageService/:id`
- `PATCH /editService/:id`

Authentication is handled using middleware: `verifyToken`.

---

## 📁 Sample Request Format

### Add a New Service

```json
POST /addService

{
  "img": "https://example.com/service.jpg",
  "service": "Home Repair",
  "price": 50,
  "area": "Dhaka",
  "description": "Quick home repair at affordable price.",
  "serviceProviderName": "John Doe",
  "serviceProviderEmail": "john@example.com",
  "serviceProviderImg": "https://example.com/user.jpg"
}
```

---

## 🔐 JWT Authentication Flow

1. After logging in via Firebase on the frontend, user email is sent to:
   ```
   POST https://serv-ease-server-rupongomez-rupongomezs-projects.vercel.app/jwt
   ```
2. Server generates a JWT token and sets it as a secure HTTP-only cookie.
3. Token is sent with every request to protected routes.
4. On logout, the cookie is cleared:
   ```
   GET https://serv-ease-server-rupongomez-rupongomezs-projects.vercel.app/logout
   ```

---

## 📝 Notes

- All sensitive data (Firebase keys, DB credentials) are hidden using environment variables.
- CORS is configured to allow requests only from trusted origins.
- Cookies are set with `secure: true`, `httpOnly: true`, and `sameSite: 'none'`.
- Uses MongoDB for scalable and flexible data storage.
- Fully deployed on **Vercel**.

## 📦 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following:

```env
PORT=5000
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.u6wg9.mongodb.net/ServEase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

> ⚠️ Replace values with your actual secrets before deployment.
